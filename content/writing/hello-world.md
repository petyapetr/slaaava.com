This isn't my first attempt starting a blog. I ditched social media, but wanted to have some place to share my thoughts. Owning a place for yourself on the internet seems like a nice thing to do. So I rolled with this personal website.

I'm not sure, what is it going to look like. Realistically, this site might only couple entries, written in the beginning. Completely abandoned after that, with no updates for a couple of years, and “expired domain” left at the end. However, writing might stick with me for longer this time. At least, I hope it will.

English isn't my mother tongue. Punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure might be all over the place. That's also something, that I wish to work on with this blog. 

My girlfriend proofreads my writings — love you, hun. I might occasionally use llms to check the grammar. Never will I use it to provide ideas, write for me, or edit my texts. 

I believe that there is no value for others to read yours llm replies. I would much rather [read the prompt](https://claytonwramsey.com/blog/prompt). So enjoy this sloppy mess of the words here, knowing that they, at least, are all typed by a human.

I plan to write here about my frustration with tech, about my work with web gis. Maybe some about trails — I run, books — I read, links — I hoard, and anything — I find interesting.

Thanks for checking this one out. 

Peace
