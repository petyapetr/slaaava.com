This isn't my first attempt starting a blog. I ditched social media, but wanted to have some place to share my thoughts. Owning a place for yourself on the internet seems like a nice thing to do. So I rolled with this personal website.

I'm not sure, what is it going to look like. Realistically, this site might only have this and a couple more entries, written in the beginning. Completely abandoned after that, with no updates for a couple of years, and finally — “domain expired”. However, writing might stick with me for longer this time. At least, I hope it will.

English isn't my mother tongue. Punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure might be all over the place. That's also something, that I wish to work on with this blog. 

My girlfriend proofreads my writings — love you, hun. I might occasionally use llms to check the grammar. Never will I use it to provide me ideas, write for me, or edit me texts. 

I believe that there is no value for others to read yours llm replies. I would much rather [read the prompt](https://claytonwramsey.com/blog/prompt). So enjoy this sloppy mess of the words here, knowing that they were, at least, all typed by a human.

I plan to write here about my frustration with tech, about my work with web gis. Maybe some about trails — I run, books — I read, links — I hoard, and anything, which I might find interesting.

Thanks for checking this out. 

Peace
