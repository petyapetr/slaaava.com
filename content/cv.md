I’m a web developer passionate about making geospatial apps for the web. My process is driven by the problem itself, not the technology used to solve it. I strive to build simple and explicit products, where form follows function and complexity matches necessity.

## Experience

**Lead Software Developer — Geovibe**

_November 2023 — Present_

In this role I lead cross-team projects that involve satellite and drone imagery analysis, data aggregation, event notifications, and data visualization. I also set and direct the technical vision for product development, guiding both engineering-driven work—such as developing customer products (e.g., asset management and analytics solutions in the farming domain built around satellite imagery exploration) and product-driven projects that involve designing systems from scratch (e.g., the GIS part of a solar plant ERP dashboard, integrating drone imagery exploration, task force management, and IoT live tracking; as well as a mapping component built into a water management crm, powering geospatial exploration and data driven insights).

**Software Developer — Bariant**

_September 2022 — March 2023_

As a software developer, I implemented features for the company’s web GIS platform. I worked on creating map editing components in Vue using the ArcGIS SDK. Together with our team and WWF Russia, I developed an interface for a satellite imagery analysis app.

**Associate Software Developer — Bariant**

_July 2021 — August 2022_

## Other

**Backend Developer — Helpdesk Foundation**

_February 2025_

I extended an existing Supabase backend by implementing functionality that allows users to leave and retrieve messages alongside with a donation.

**Tutor — Freelance**

_April 2024 — May 2025_

I tutor a high school student in web development fundamentals, guiding him in building his first couple of websites.

**Software Developer — Volunteers Tbilisi**

_April 2024 – July 2024_

I developed a serverless proof of concept for a non-profit aid hotline, streamlining helpdesk requests with automations and webhook integrations.
