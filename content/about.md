# About Me

Hi! I'm Slava Zakharov _(he/him)_, and I write software. 

I'm deeply passionate about maps and the web. As a developer I have the privilege of working in the domain, in which I'm really interested in. I'm grateful that I get to create useful things, and not to harm anyone. That's not given.

Originally from Saint-Petersburg, I'm currently based in Yerevan.

My professional record can be found [here](/cv). To keep updated with my work, follow me on [github](https://github.com/petyapetr).

I spend my weekends running in the mountains, enjoy reading, and whish to write more often. Used to record a
[podcast](https://deepcuts.ru/podcast) (ru).

Feel free to [email](mailto:slava.zakharov@mailbox.org) me anything. Alternatively — reach out on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/beaterpetr.bsky.social).
